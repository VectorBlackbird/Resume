<h1>My Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<h2>I don't really have many hobbies that I can think of, apart from going for walks in the park to clear my head. But I do have many interests, most of which are technology and engineering related.</h2>

<h2>Aviation</h2>
<h3>I've had a strong interest in aviation and rocketry since my childhood. I remember doing this project where I was to launch a rocket into the air and land an egg safely on the ground, which it did. This sparked a huge motivation in me to get into the engineering field. Along the way I became interested in different types of propulsion and their various uses, flight dynamics and how lift is produced, different types of fuel, and so forth. My favorite aircraft of all time is the legendary Lockheed Martin SR-71 Blackbird. </h3>
<h2>Computers and Electronics</h2>
<h3>My interest in computers sparked at a young age when I had this really old desktop computer that wouldn't work. I opened it up to find all this components and chips and so forth, and I started thinking to myself "how does this thing even work?". Since then I slowly became more and more familiary with computers, even software. I upgraded my own parts, replaced my own screens, jailbroke my first ipod touch, and began learning more and more complex and cool ways to use programming to solve real problems.</h3>
<h2>Military Technology</h2>
<h3>What facinates me about military technology, whether it be related to the air force or the marines or even just weapons or defense systems, it is that they have cutting edge and most of the time extremely creative solutions to the problems they are facing.</h3>
<h2>Staying Healthy</h2>
<h3>I'm a firm believer in taking care of one's body. I do enjoy strength training at the gym and going for a run every now and then to clear my head.</h3>
